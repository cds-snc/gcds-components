# Changelog

## v1.0.0
Released on: 2026-xx-xx

## 🎉 GCDS Components v1.0.0 is now available

**GCDS Components** are reusable user interface building blocks designed to support a range of user objectives across the GC Design System. Each component is provided with production-ready code, best-practice guidance, and built-in accessibility considerations to ensure consistent, inclusive implementations across design and development.

This release marks the **official stable release** of GCDS Components and confirms that the package is **fully production-ready**.

## 🚀 From alpha to stable

This product was previously released as an **alpha package** under the name **`@cdssnc/gcds-components`**.

It has now been **republished as a stable package** under a new name and namespace: **`@gcds-core/components`**.

With this release:

- The package is now considered **stable, production-ready, and supported for long-term use**
- The API has been intentionally reviewed and aligned with design to establish a **clear, reliable contract**
- Future updates will follow **semantic versioning guarantees**

> **Breaking changes will only occur in major releases**, not in minor updates or patches.

## 🎨 API Stabilization

As part of the v1.0.0 release, we undertook a comprehensive review of the Components API to ensure it is **intentional, consistent, and aligned with design guidance**.

This work allows us to confidently guarantee API stability within the `1.x` release line, so teams can adopt GCDS Components knowing that **minor and patch releases will not introduce breaking changes**.

Refer to the migration guide for details on the API changes and alignment work completed as part of this release.

## 🔀 Migration required (from `@cdssnc/gcds-components`)

If you're currently using **`@cdssnc/gcds-components`**, you’ll need to migrate to continue receiving updates, fixes, and future improvements.

👉 **Follow the migration guide:**  
**[Migrating from @cdssnc/gcds-components to @gcds-core/components](.docs/migration/stable-v1.md)**

**Note**: Since GCDS Components was previously released as an alpha product (`@cdssnc/gcds-components`), we’ve kept an archived version of the CHANGELOG, which can be found [here](archived/CHANGELOG.md).

The `@cdssnc/gcds-components` package has been deprecated on npm and will no longer receive updates or bug fixes. We strongly recommend migrating to `@gcds-core/components` to continue benefiting from future releases.
